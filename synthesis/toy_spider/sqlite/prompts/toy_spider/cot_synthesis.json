The specified model for embedding should be 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2', as indicated in the reference solution, since it is likely the embedding model used in the database setup or expected for consistent vector representation.\n\n4. **Specify the Number of Nearest Neighbors (`k`)**: The question suggests finding the \"best associated\" match. Typically, this implies retrieving the closest match, which corresponds to `k = 1`.\n\n5. **Construct the SQL Query**:\n   - Select the `id` from `Web_client_accelerator`.\n   - Use the `MATCH lembed` syntax with `Operating_system_embedding` to find the closest match to the operating system description.\n   - Limit the results to the top match, which corresponds to setting `k = 1`.\n\nWith these steps in mind, the SQL query is constructed as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id\nFROM Web_client_accelerator\nWHERE Operating_system_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', \"Appliance (Linux)\")\nAND k = 1;\n```",
      "To solve this problem, we need to find the ID of the web client accelerator that is most closely associated with the given description of an operating system, \"Appliance (Linux).\" We have the `Web_client_accelerator` virtual table at our disposal, which includes a vector column for operating system embeddings (`Operating_system_embedding`). \n\nHere's how we'll approach creating the SQL query:\n\n1. **Target the \"Web_client_accelerator\" Virtual Table**: Since `Web_client_accelerator` contains the `Operating_system_embedding` column, it is the appropriate table to query.\n\n2. **Use Vector Search with MATCH**: The vector extension allows us to perform similarity searches using the `MATCH` operator. The syntax requires specifying `lembed(model_name, search_text)` within the `MATCH` clause. The query also needs to specify the number of nearest neighbors, `k`, to find the best match.\n\n3. **Select the Required Field**: We only need the `id` of the web client accelerator, which is mentioned in the question.\n\n4. **Order by Similarity and Limit Results**: Since we want the best association, we should find the top match. Using `k = 1` ensures that we get the single best match.\n\nBy following these steps, we derive the final SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id\nFROM Web_client_accelerator\nWHERE Operating_system_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Appliance (Linux)')\nAND k = 1;\n```",

This table contains columns related to the operating system and embeddings for vector similarity searches.\n\n2. **Understand the Vector Search Requirement**: We need to find the web client accelerator best associated with the operating system described as \"Appliance (Linux).\" This requires performing a vector similarity search on the `Operating_system_embedding` column, using the provided search text \"Appliance (Linux).\"\n\n3. **Match Syntax**: As per the vector search extension, the query must use the syntax `Operating_system_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text')`, where `model_name` is the name of the model to be used for embedding the search text. Additionally, we should specify the number of nearest neighbors (`k`) to find; in this case, we are looking for the best match, so `k = 1`.\n\n4. **Construct the Query**: The query will select the `id` from `Web_client_accelerator` where the `Operating_system_embedding` matches the vector embedding of \"Appliance (Linux)\" using the model 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'. We set `k = 1` to return the single nearest neighbor.\n\nThe final SQL query is constructed as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id\nFROM Web_client_accelerator\nWHERE Operating_system_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Appliance (Linux)')\nAND k = 1;\n```",

We use the `Operating_system_embedding` column to perform a vector similarity search.\n   - The `MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text')` syntax will be used to find embeddings most similar to \"Appliance (Linux)\".\n   \n3. **Select the ID:**\n   - We need to select the `id` of the web client accelerator as the final output.\n\n4. **Limit the Results:**\n   - The task is to find the single best match, so we will limit the results to 1.\n\n5. **Use Correct Syntax for Vector Search:**\n   - The `MATCH lembed()` function should specify the model as 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2', and the search text is \"Appliance (Linux)\".\n   - Additionally, the `k = 1` clause ensures we are retrieving the single most similar result.\n\nBased on these steps, the final SQL query is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id\nFROM Web_client_accelerator\nWHERE Operating_system_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Appliance (Linux') AND k = 1;\n```",
      "To translate the given natural language question into an executable SQL query, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Main Table**: \n   - The question is asking for the ID of the web client accelerator best associated with a particular operating system description. This suggests we'll be working with the `Web_client_accelerator` virtual table, which has columns related to operating systems.\n\n2. **Understand Vector Search Requirement**:\n   - The question specifies finding an association using an embedding (vector search). This implies we need to use the vector similarity search capability provided by the virtual table `Web_client_accelerator`.\n\n3. **Determine the Correct Embedding Column**:\n   - For this query, we are interested in the `Operating_system_embedding` column since it relates to operating system descriptions.\n\n4. **Use the MATCH Operator for Vector Search**:\n   - The syntax for vector similarity searches involves using the `MATCH` operator with `lembed()`. The question specifies the operating system description as \"Appliance (Linux)\".\n\n5. **Specify the Model and Number of Neighbors (`k`)**:\n   - According to the schema and task instructions, we will use the model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. The number of nearest neighbors (`k`) to find is typically set to 1 for finding the best match.\n\n6. **Construct the SQL Query**:\n   - With these components in mind, the query will select the `id` from `Web_client_accelerator` where the operating system embedding matches the embedding of the given description with `k=1`.\n\nHere is the final SQL query based on the steps above:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id\nFROM Web_client_accelerator\nWHERE Operating_system_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Appliance (Linux)')\nAND k = 1;\n```"

      "To solve the problem of finding the top five web client accelerators most similar to the Windows Server operating system, and their compatible browsers with a market share greater than 5%, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. **Vector Similarity Search**: The core of the problem is a vector similarity search using the `Operating_system_embedding` column in the `Web_client_accelerator` table. We need to find the top 5 web client accelerators that are most similar to \"Windows Server\". This requires using the `lembed` function with the `Operating_system_embedding` vector column and the query text \"Windows Server\". According to the given syntax, we will use `MATCH` and `k = 5` to find the five nearest neighbors.\n\n2. **Fetch the Necessary Columns**: From the result of the vector similarity search, we only need the `id` of the accelerators, as we will use this to join with other tables.\n\n3. **Compatible Browsers**: We need to find browsers compatible with these accelerators. This involves joining with the `accelerator_compatible_browser` table on `accelerator_id` and the `browser` table on `browser_id`.\n\n4. **Filter Browsers by Market Share**: We must filter these browsers based on their market share, specifically those with a market share greater than 5%.\n\n5. **Return Required Columns**: Finally, the query should return the `id` of the web client accelerators and the `name` of the compatible browsers.\n\nHere is the step-by-step construction of the SQL query:\n\n- Start with a `SELECT` statement to retrieve `id` and the `browser_name`.\n- Use a `WHERE` clause to perform the vector similarity search on `Operating_system_embedding` using the `MATCH lembed` syntax, specifying `k = 5` for top 5 results.\n- Join `accelerator_compatible_browser` and `browser` tables appropriately.\n- Add a `WHERE` clause to filter browsers with a market share greater than 5%.\n\nHere's the complete SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  wca.id, \n  b.name AS browser_name\nFROM \n  Web_client_accelerator wca\nJOIN \n  accelerator_compatible_browser acb ON wca.id = acb.accelerator_id\nJOIN \n  browser b ON acb.browser_id = b.id\nWHERE \n  wca.Operating_system_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Windows Server') AND k = 5\n  AND b.market_share > 5;\n```",

      "To address the given natural language question, we need to find the top 5 accelerators that are compatible with Chrome and are most similar to \"Internet Service Providers\" based on their client embeddings. We will retrieve their names, clients, and similarity scores.\n\nLet's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**: \n   - We need the `Web_client_accelerator` table to get information about the accelerators, specifically their names and clients.\n   - The `accelerator_compatible_browser` table will help us find accelerators that are compatible with Chrome.\n   - The `browser` table provides the browser names, allowing us to filter for Chrome.\n\n2. **Filter for Chrome compatibility**:\n   - Perform a join between `accelerator_compatible_browser` and `browser` where `browser.name = 'Chrome'`, and then join this result with `Web_client_accelerator` to get accelerators compatible with Chrome.\n\n3. **Perform vector similarity match**:\n   - Use the `Client_embedding` column in the `Web_client_accelerator` table to find accelerators similar to \"Internet Service Providers\". We'll use the vector similarity search syntax: `Client_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`.\n\n4. **Select and order the results**:\n   - We need to select the name, client, and similarity measure (which can be derived from the vector similarity operation).\n   - Only the top 5 closest matches are required, so we'll order by similarity and limit the results to 5.\n\nNow, here's the SQL query incorporating these steps:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  wca.name AS accelerator_name,\n  wca.Client,\n  wca.distance\nFROM\n  Web_client_accelerator wca\nJOIN\n  accelerator_compatible_browser acb ON wca.id = acb.accelerator_id\nJOIN\n  browser b ON acb.browser_id = b.id\nWHERE\n  b.name = 'Chrome'\n  AND wca.Client_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Internet Service Provider') AND k = 5\nORDER BY\n  wca.distance\nLIMIT 5;\n```",
      "To solve the given problem, we need to find the top 5 accelerators that are compatible with the Chrome browser and are most similar to the concept of \"Internet Service Providers\" based on their client embeddings. Here's the breakdown of how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify Accelerators Compatible with Chrome:**\n   - First, we need to select accelerators that are compatible with the Chrome browser. This involves joining the tables `Web_client_accelerator`, `accelerator_compatible_browser`, and `browser` to filter accelerators that work with Chrome.\n\n2. **Perform Vector Similarity Search:**\n   - Utilize the vector search capabilities on the `Client_embedding` column from the `Web_client_accelerator` table. We need to match the embeddings against the text \"Internet Service Provider\" using the specified syntax `MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`.\n\n3. **Select Relevant Information:**\n   - For the results, we need to select the names of the accelerators, their clients, and how closely they match the specified concept based on the vector similarity.\n\n4. **Return Top Results:**\n   - Ensure the query returns the top 5 results ordered by their similarity score.\n\nHere is the complete SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  wca.name AS accelerator_name,\n  wca.Client AS client,\n  similarity_distance\nFROM\n  Web_client_accelerator wca\nJOIN\n  accelerator_compatible_browser acb ON wca.id = acb.accelerator_id\nJOIN\n  browser b ON acb.browser_id = b.id\nWHERE\n  b.name = 'Chrome'\n  AND wca.Client_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Internet Service Provider') AND k = 5\nORDER BY\n  similarity_distance\nLIMIT 5;\n```",
      "To address the given question, we need to focus on several key components: finding accelerators compatible with Chrome, utilizing vector search to identify those similar to \"Internet Service Provider\", and outputting the top 5 results based on similarity. The tables relevant for this query are `Web_client_accelerator`, which contains accelerator details, and `accelerator_compatible_browser`, which associates accelerators with browsers. We will use the vector search capabilities on the `Client_embedding` column to determine similarity to \"Internet Service Provider\".\n\nLet's break down the task into steps:\n\n1. **Identify Compatible Accelerators**: We need to select accelerators that are compatible with Chrome. For this, we use a join between `accelerator_compatible_browser` and `browser` to filter out accelerators that work with Chrome.\n\n2. **Vector Similarity Search**: We perform a vector similarity search on the `Client_embedding` column to find accelerators similar to \"Internet Service Provider\". The syntax required is `MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`.\n\n3. **Select Required Columns**: We are interested in the name and client of the accelerators as well as their matching score. To get this, we select `name`, `Client`, and any relevant similarity score.\n\n4. **Limit Results**: We limit the results to the top 5 most similar accelerators.\n\nNow, putting these steps together, the SQL query is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  wca.name AS accelerator_name,\n  wca.Client\nFROM\n  Web_client_accelerator wca\nJOIN\n  accelerator_compatible_browser acb ON wca.id = acb.accelerator_id\nJOIN\n  browser b ON acb.browser_id = b.id\nWHERE\n  b.name = 'Chrome'\n  AND wca.Client_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Internet Service Provider') AND k = 5\nORDER BY\n  wca.Client_embedding;\n```",
      "To generate the SQL query for the given question, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements:**\n   - We need the top 5 accelerators that are compatible with Chrome and are most similar to Internet Service Providers.\n   - Information needed includes their names, clients, and similarity.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns:**\n   - We need to use the `Web_client_accelerator` table to get accelerators' names and clients.\n   - We need to filter accelerators compatible with Chrome using the `accelerator_compatible_browser` and `browser` tables.\n   - The `Client_embedding` column in the `Web_client_accelerator` table is required for performing vector similarity search related to \"Internet Service Provider\".\n\n3. **Perform the Compatibility Filter:**\n   - Join `accelerator_compatible_browser` with `browser` to get accelerators compatible with Chrome.\n\n4. **Vector Similarity Search:**\n   - Use the `Client_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N` syntax to find the top 5 accelerators most similar to \"Internet Service Provider\".\n\n5. **Select the Necessary Columns:**\n   - Select the name and client from `Web_client_accelerator`.\n\n6. **Order the Results:**\n   - Results should be ordered by similarity, but since the distance metric isn't explicitly provided in the schema, we'll focus on retrieving the top 5 matches.\n\nNow, let's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n  wca.name AS accelerator_name,\n  wca.Client\nFROM\n  Web_client_accelerator wca\nJOIN\n  accelerator_compatible_browser acb ON wca.id = acb.accelerator_id\nJOIN\n  browser b ON acb.browser_id = b.id\nWHERE\n  b.name = 'Chrome'\n  AND wca.Client_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Internet Service Provider') AND k = 5;\n```",
      "1. **Understanding the Question**:\n   - We need to find the top 5 accelerators that work with the browser \"Chrome\".\n   - These accelerators should closely match the concept of \"Internet Service Providers\".\n   - We need to retrieve the names, clients, and how closely they match.\n\n2. **Review Database Schema**:\n   - The relevant tables for this query are `Web_client_accelerator`, `browser`, and `accelerator_compatible_browser`.\n   - `Web_client_accelerator` contains attributes like `name`, `Client`, and `Client_embedding`.\n   - `browser` contains the browser `name`, and `accelerator_compatible_browser` establishes a relationship between accelerators and browsers.\n\n3. **Determine Joins and Conditions**:\n   - Join `Web_client_accelerator` with `accelerator_compatible_browser` to filter accelerators compatible with Chrome.\n   - Join `accelerator_compatible_browser` with `browser` to ensure the browser name is \"Chrome\".\n   - Use the vector search functionality to find accelerators most similar to \"Internet Service Provider\" using the `Client_embedding`.\n\n4. **Construct the SQL Query**:\n   - The SQL will select accelerator names and clients where the client embedding matches the concept of \"Internet Service Provider\".\n   - Use the vector search syntax to retrieve the top 5 closest matches.\n   - Order the results based on similarity distance.\n\n5. **Final SQL Query**:\n```sql\nSELECT\n  wca.name AS accelerator_name,\n  wca.Client\nFROM\n  Web_client_accelerator wca\nJOIN\n  accelerator_compatible_browser acb ON wca.id = acb.accelerator_id\nJOIN\n  browser b ON acb.browser_id = b.id\nWHERE\n  b.name = 'Chrome'\n  AND wca.Client_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Internet Service Provider') AND k = 5;\n```"

This table contains `Host_city_ID` to relate it to the city table and `Theme_embedding` to perform a vector search.\n\n2. **Perform Vector Similarity Search**:\n   - We will use the `MATCH` operator on the `Theme_embedding` column in the `farm_competition` table to find themes similar to \"Agriculture Innovation\".\n   - The syntax for the vector search is `vector_column MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`.

The vector search syntax should be `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Celebration of Harvest Festival') AND k = 5`, indicating we are looking for the top 5 matches.\n\n3. **Join Tables**: Once we have the relevant competitions, we will join the results with the `city` table using the `Host_city_ID` from the `farm_competition` table and `City_ID` from the `city` table to get the `Official_Name` of the hosting cities.\n\n4. **Select the Required Columns**: Finally, we will select the `Official_Name` of the cities and the `Competition_ID` of the competitions.\n\nHere is the final SQL query encapsulating all these steps:\n\n```sql\nWITH ThemeBasedCompetitions AS (\n  SELECT Competition_ID, Host_city_ID\n  FROM farm_competition\n  WHERE Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Celebration of Harvest Festival')\n  AND k = 5\n)\n\nSELECT c.Official_Name, fc.Competition_ID\nFROM ThemeBasedCompetitions fc\nJOIN city c ON fc.Host_city_ID = c.City_ID;\n```\n",
      "To solve the problem of identifying the official names of cities hosting the top 5 competitions themed around \"Celebration of Harvest Festival\" and their respective competition IDs, we need to proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Table**: The `farm_competition` table contains information about competitions, including the `Theme` and a vector column `Theme_embedding` for semantic search. It also includes the `Competition_ID` and the `Host_city_ID`.\n\n2. **Perform Vector Similarity Search**: To find competitions themed around \"Celebration of Harvest Festival\", we utilize the vector similarity search on the `Theme_embedding` column. We need to find the top 5 closest matches, so we use the `MATCH lembed` syntax.\n\n3. **Join with City Table**: After identifying the relevant competitions, we need to join the results with the `city` table to get the official names of the cities. The join condition is between `Host_city_ID` from the `farm_competition` table and `City_ID` from the `city` table.\n\n4. **Select Relevant Columns**: Finally, we select the `Official_Name` of the city and the `Competition_ID`.\n\nHere is the SQL query implementing the above steps:\n\n```sql\nWITH ThemeBasedCompetitions AS (\n  SELECT Competition_ID, Host_city_ID\n  FROM farm_competition\n  WHERE Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Celebration of Harvest Festival')\n  AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT c.Official_Name, tbc.Competition_ID\nFROM ThemeBasedCompetitions tbc\nJOIN city c ON tbc.Host_city_ID = c.City_ID;\n```",

The search text is \"Celebration of Harvest Festival\". We specify `k = 5` to find the top 5 nearest neighbors, i.e., the 5 competitions most similar to the theme.\n\n3. **Join Tables**:\n   - After identifying the top 5 competitions, join the results with the `city` table to get the official names of the host cities. This can be achieved by linking `Host_city_ID` from `farm_competition` with `City_ID` from `city`.\n\n4. **Select Required Columns**:\n   - Select the `Official_Name` of the city and the `Competition_ID` from the resulting joined tables.\n\nFollowing these steps, the SQL query becomes:\n\n```sql\nWITH ThemeBasedCompetitions AS (\n  SELECT Competition_ID, Host_city_ID\n  FROM farm_competition\n  WHERE Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Celebration of Harvest Festival') AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT c.Official_Name, fc.Competition_ID\nFROM ThemeBasedCompetitions fc\nJOIN city c ON fc.Host_city_ID = c.City_ID;\n```"

      "To address the question, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Competitions in 2022 with Relevant Theme**: We are tasked to find competitions hosted in 2022 with a theme similar to \"Harvest Festival\". This requires using a vector similarity search on the `Theme_embedding` column of the `farm_competition` table. We will use the `MATCH` operator with `lembed` function for this purpose, specifying the top 5 most similar events.\n\n2. **Count Hosted Competitions by City**: After identifying these competitions, we need to determine which city hosted the most of these competitions. This involves grouping the results by `Host_city_ID` and counting the number of competitions for each city.\n\n3. **Retrieve City Name**: Once we have the counts, we need to join with the `city` table to get the official name of the city that hosted the most competitions.\n\nThe SQL query structure will be as follows:\n\n- Use a subquery to select competitions with themes similar to \"Harvest Festival\" using vector similarity search in 2022.\n- Group these filtered competitions by their host city ID and count them.\n- Order the cities by the count of competitions they hosted and select the top city.\n\nNow, let's construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nWITH Similar_Competitions AS (\n    SELECT \n        Competition_ID, \n        Host_city_ID\n    FROM \n        farm_competition\n    WHERE \n        Year = 2022\n        AND Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Harvest Festival') AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT \n    c.Official_Name\nFROM \n    Similar_Competitions sc\nJOIN \n    city c ON sc.Host_city_ID = c.City_ID\nGROUP BY \n    c.Official_Name\nORDER BY \n    COUNT(sc.Competition_ID) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```",

Specifically, we need to focus on the top 5 most similar events based on the theme embedding.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables**:\n   - We need to use the `farm_competition` table, as it contains information about competitions, including the theme and host city.\n   - The `city` table will be used to find the official names of cities based on their IDs.\n\n2. **Filter Competitions by Year and Theme**:\n   - First, filter competitions that occurred in the year 2022.\n   - Use vector similarity search syntax to find competitions whose theme is most similar to \"Harvest Festival\": `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Harvest Festival') AND k = 5`.\n\n3. **Group and Count Host Cities**:\n   - For the filtered set of competitions, group by the `Host_city_ID` to count how many competitions each city hosted.\n   \n4. **Join with City Table**:\n   - To get the city's official name, join the results with the `city` table using the `Host_city_ID`.\n\n5. **Order and Limit Results**:\n   - Order the results based on the count of competitions hosted by each city in descending order.\n   - Limit the result to the top city.\n\nThe SQL query is therefore structured as follows:\n\n```sql\nWITH Similar_Competitions AS (\n    SELECT \n        Host_city_ID\n    FROM \n        farm_competition\n    WHERE \n        Year = 2022\n        AND Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Harvest Festival') AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT \n    c.Official_Name\nFROM \n    Similar_Competitions sc\nJOIN \n    city c ON sc.Host_city_ID = c.City_ID\nGROUP BY \n    c.Official_Name\nORDER BY \n    COUNT(sc.Host_city_ID) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```",

The syntax for this is `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`, where `N` is the number of nearest neighbors. In this case, we need the top 5 similar themes.\n\n3. **Identify Host City**: With the filtered and matched competitions, we'll determine which city hosted each competition by joining the results with the `city` table using `Host_city_ID`.\n\n4. **Count Competitions per City**: We'll group the results by `Official_Name` of the city and count the number of competitions hosted by each city.\n\n5. **Find the City with Most Competitions**: Finally, we'll sort the results in descending order of the count of competitions and limit the results to the top entry to find the city that hosted the most similar competitions.\n\nCombining these steps, the SQL query is as follows:\n\n```sql\nWITH Similar_Competitions AS (\n    SELECT \n        Competition_ID,\n        Host_city_ID\n    FROM \n        farm_competition \n    WHERE \n        Year = 2022\n        AND Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', \"Harvest Festival\") AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT \n    c.Official_Name\nFROM \n    Similar_Competitions sc\nJOIN \n    city c ON sc.Host_city_ID = c.City_ID\nGROUP BY \n    c.Official_Name\nORDER BY \n    COUNT(sc.Competition_ID) DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```",

      "To translate the natural language question into an executable SQL query, we need to identify the necessary tables and columns, apply the vector search for similarity, and retrieve the top 10 relevant competitions with their ranks and themes. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables**:\n   - We need to find competitions and their themes. Therefore, the `farm_competition` table is necessary as it contains the `Theme` and `Theme_embedding`.\n   - We also need to retrieve the ranks of these competitions, which are stored in the `competition_record` table.\n\n2. **Perform Vector Similarity Search**:\n   - For vector similarity search, we use the syntax `vector_column MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`. Here, we should search for themes related to \"Agricultural advancements\" using the `Theme_embedding` column.\n   - We set `k = 10` to find the top 10 most related competitions.\n\n3. **Join Tables to Retrieve Required Fields**:\n   - Join `farm_competition` with `competition_record` using `Competition_ID` to get the `Rank` for each competition.\n\n4. **Select Required Columns and Order Results**:\n   - Select `Competition_ID`, `Rank`, and `Theme`.\n   - Order the results by similarity (usually the distance or relevance rank) to ensure we get the top 10 most relevant competitions.\n\n5. **Limit the Results**:\n   - Limit the output to the top 10 competitions.\n\nNow, let's construct the SQL query following these steps:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  fc.Competition_ID,\n  cr.Rank,\n  fc.Theme\nFROM \n  farm_competition fc\nJOIN \n  competition_record cr ON fc.Competition_ID = cr.Competition_ID\nWHERE \n  fc.Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Agricultural advancements') \n  AND k = 10\nORDER BY \n  cr.Rank\nLIMIT 10;\n```",
      "To convert the natural language question into an executable SQL query, let's break down the requirements:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Table**: The table that contains information about competitions is `farm_competition`. This table is relevant because it houses the `Theme` and `Theme_embedding` columns necessary for vector similarity search.\n\n2. **Vector Similarity Condition**: We need to find competitions related to \"agricultural advancements\" using vector similarity search on the `Theme_embedding` column. This requires using the syntax: `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`.\n\n3. **Join with Related Tables**: Since we also need the ranks, a join with the `competition_record` table is necessary. This table connects `Competition_ID` with `Farm_ID` and provides the `Rank`.\n\n4. **Select Required Columns**: The question asks for the competition themes and ranks. Thus, select `Rank` from `competition_record` and `Theme` from `farm_competition`.\n\n5. **Limit Results**: Finally, limit the results to the top 10 competitions based on vector similarity.\n\n6. **Sort Results**: Since the SQL query syntax for vector similarity doesn't automatically sort by relevance, ensure that the results are sorted appropriately if the vector extension provides a similarity score or distance.\n\nWith these elements in mind, the SQL query should be constructed as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  cr.Rank, \n  fc.Theme\nFROM \n  competition_record cr\nJOIN \n  farm_competition fc ON cr.Competition_ID = fc.Competition_ID\nWHERE \n  fc.Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', \"Agricultural advancements\") \n  AND k = 10\nORDER BY \n  fc.Theme_embedding\nLIMIT 10;\n```",
      "To translate the given natural language question into an SQL query, we need to identify the relevant tables and columns, and apply vector similarity search to find the top competitions related to agricultural advancements.\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Tables**: \n   - The `farm_competition` table contains details about competitions, including their themes and embeddings.\n   - The `competition_record` table includes ranks related to competitions.\n\n2. **Vector Similarity Search**:\n   - We need to find the competitions whose themes are most related to \"agricultural advancements\". This requires a vector similarity search on the `Theme_embedding` column using the provided syntax.\n\n3. **Joining Tables**:\n   - We must join the `farm_competition` table with the `competition_record` table to get the rank information along with the theme.\n\n4. **Sort and Limit Results**:\n   - Once we have matched competitions, we should sort them by their similarity distance and limit the results to the top 10.\n\n5. **Formulate the SQL Query**:\n   - Select `Competition_ID`, `Rank`, and `Theme` from the joined tables.\n   - Use `MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N` to perform the vector similarity search.\n   - Order the results by distance (implied by the similarity search) and limit to 10.\n\nNow, let's write the final query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  fc.Competition_ID,\n  cr.Rank,\n  fc.Theme\nFROM \n  farm_competition fc\nJOIN \n  competition_record cr ON fc.Competition_ID = cr.Competition_ID\nWHERE \n  fc.Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Agricultural advancements') \n  AND k = 10\nORDER BY \n  fc.Theme_embedding -- Assuming the order by the MATCH function implicitly orders by similarity distance.\nLIMIT 10;\n```",
      "To address the question, we need to retrieve information about competitions that are closely related to the concept of \"agricultural advancements.\" The relevant tables for this task are `farm_competition` for theme information and `competition_record` for rank details.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to construct the SQL query:\n\n1. **Identify the tables involved**:\n   - `farm_competition`: Contains the theme and theme embedding, which we'll use for vector similarity search.\n   - `competition_record`: Contains rank information of the competitions.\n\n2. **Perform a vector similarity search**:\n   - Use the `MATCH lembed` syntax on the `Theme_embedding` column to find competitions related to \"Agricultural advancements.\"\n   - Specify `k = 10` to find the top 10 nearest neighbors, as the question asks for the top 10 competitions.\n\n3. **Join the tables**:\n   - Join `farm_competition` and `competition_record` on `Competition_ID` to associate ranks with themes.\n\n4. **Select the desired output columns**:\n   - Select `Competition_ID`, `Rank`, and `Theme` as the output columns since these are the pieces of information required by the question.\n\n5. **Order and limit the results**:\n   - Order by similarity (distance) if necessary, though the vector search should already handle this.\n   - Limit the output to the top 10 results.\n\nNow, let's construct the SQL query based on the above plan:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  fc.Competition_ID,\n  cr.Rank,\n  fc.Theme\nFROM \n  farm_competition fc\nJOIN \n  competition_record cr ON fc.Competition_ID = cr.Competition_ID\nWHERE \n  fc.Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Agricultural advancements') \n  AND k = 10;\n```",

The `Rank` is found in the `competition_record` table, which can be joined using `Competition_ID`.\n\n2. **Perform Vector Similarity Search**:\n   - Use the syntax `MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N` on the `Theme_embedding` column to find the competitions whose themes are most related to \"Agricultural advancements\". The model name provided is `'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'`.\n   - Specify `k = 10` to limit the results to the top 10 nearest neighbors.\n\n3. **Join Tables**:\n   - Perform a join between `farm_competition` and `competition_record` tables on `Competition_ID` to get the `Rank` of each competition.\n\n4. **Select and Order Results**:\n   - Select `Competition_ID`, `Rank`, and `Theme` from the results.\n   - Order the results by the distance to ensure the closest matches are returned first, though the vector search typically handles this automatically.\n\n5. **Limit the Result**:\n   - Use `LIMIT 10` to restrict the output to the top 10 competitions.\n\nThe final SQL query is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  fc.Competition_ID, \n  cr.Rank, \n  fc.Theme\nFROM \n  farm_competition fc\nJOIN \n  competition_record cr ON fc.Competition_ID = cr.Competition_ID\nWHERE \n  fc.Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Agricultural advancements') \n  AND k = 10;\n```"

      "To translate the natural language question into an executable SQL query, let's follow the steps below:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements**: The task is to identify one player whose injury details are most closely associated with a knee injury. This requires finding the player with the highest similarity in injury details to the concept of a \"knee injury\".\n\n2. **Database Schema Review**: \n   - The relevant table for this task is `injury_accident`, which includes columns such as `Player`, `Injury`, and `Injury_embedding`.\n   - The `Injury_embedding` column is a vector that can be used to perform similarity searches against the concept of a \"knee injury\".\n\n3. **Vector Similarity Search**: \n   - We are performing a vector similarity search, which will return the most similar embeddings to the concept of \"knee injury\".\n   - The syntax provided in the prompt for vector similarity searches is `vector_column MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`.\n\n4. **SQL Query Construction**:\n   - We need to match the vector column `Injury_embedding` against the embedding of \"knee injury\".\n   - Use the model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for generating the embedding of \"knee injury\".\n   - The query should return the `Player` whose injury details are the most similar (`k = 1`).\n\n5. **Final SQL Query**: The query should simply select the player's name, while using the vector embedding search to identify the most similar injury record to \"knee injury\". Thus:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player \nFROM injury_accident \nWHERE Injury_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'knee injury') AND k = 1;\n```",

      "To translate the natural language question into an SQL query, let's follow the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify the table**: The question asks about a player whose injury details are closely associated with a knee injury. This information is likely stored in the `injury_accident` table, which contains details like `Player`, `Injury`, and `Injury_embedding`.\n\n2. **Determine the vector search requirement**: We need to perform a similarity search based on the `Injury` column, specifically for \"knee injury\". The `Injury_embedding` column in the `injury_accident` table is used for this vector similarity search.\n\n3. **Vector search syntax**: According to the vector search extension in SQLite, the correct syntax is `vector_column MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`. Here, the vector column is `Injury_embedding`, the model name for embedding is `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, the search text is \"Knee injury\", and `k = 1` since we only need one player.\n\n4. **Select the required column**: We only need to retrieve the `Player` associated with the closest match to \"Knee injury\".\n\n5. **Formulate the SQL query**: Using the identified requirements, construct the SQL query.\n\nBy following these steps, we conclude with the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player \nFROM injury_accident \nWHERE Injury_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Knee injury') AND k = 1;\n```",
      "To translate the natural language question into an executable SQL query, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Question**: The task is to identify one player whose injury details are most closely associated with a knee injury. This involves a similarity search in a vector data set to find the nearest match to the query \"Knee injury\".\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**: \n   - The `injury_accident` table contains information about injuries, including the `Player` name and the `Injury_embedding`, which is a vector representation of the injury details.\n   - We must use a vector search on `Injury_embedding` to find the nearest match for \"Knee injury\".\n\n3. **Vector Search Syntax**: \n   - For vector similarity searches, the syntax to use is `vector_column MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`. In this case, the model name is 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2', and `search_text` is \"Knee injury\".\n   - We will request only the nearest neighbor, so we set `k = 1`.\n\n4. **Select the Relevant Information**: \n   - The query should select the `Player` whose injury details are most similar to a \"Knee injury\".\n\n5. **Construct the SQL Query**:\n   - Perform the vector search on the `Injury_embedding` column and select the `Player`.\n   - Limit the result to the top 1 result to get the closest match.\n\nBased on this reasoning, here is the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player\nFROM injury_accident\nWHERE Injury_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Knee injury') AND k = 1;\n```",
      "To construct an SQL query for the given question, we need to focus on the `injury_accident` table, which contains details about injuries, including a vector column `Injury_embedding` that can be used for similarity searches.\n\nHere’s how we can approach the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Relevant Table**:\n   - The question refers to \"player\" and \"injury\", which are attributes in the `injury_accident` table. Therefore, this is the table we need to query.\n\n2. **Understand the Vector Search Requirement**:\n   - We need to find the injury details that are most closely associated with a \"knee injury\" using vector similarity. This requires using the `MATCH` syntax with the embedding vector.\n\n3. **Formulate the Vector Search**:\n   - Use the `MATCH` operator to perform a vector similarity search on the `Injury_embedding` column. The search text is \"knee injury\", and this requires using `lembed('model_name', 'search_text')` for the embedding.\n   - The syntax will be `Injury_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', \"Knee injury\")`.\n\n4. **Select the Required Field**:\n   - The question asks for a player, so we need to select the `Player` column.\n\n5. **Limit to the Closest Match**:\n   - Since we want \"one player\", we need to limit the results to the top result, which implies using `LIMIT 1`.\n\n6. **Construct the SQL Query**:\n   - Combine all these elements into a single SQL query.\n\nThe final SQL query will be:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Player \nFROM injury_accident \nWHERE Injury_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', \"Knee injury\") \nAND k = 1;\n```"

      "To address the given problem, we need to perform a few operations to extract the required data. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements**:\n   - We need to find competition IDs and farm IDs for the top 5 competitions that are most relevant to an \"agricultural festival\" theme.\n   - The farms must have more than 100 cattle.\n\n2. **Identify the Relevant Tables**:\n   - The `farm` table contains information about the number of cattle.\n   - The `farm_competition` table stores the competition information including the theme and its embeddings.\n   - The `competition_record` table provides the relationship between competitions and farms.\n\n3. **Filter Farms by Cattle Count**:\n   - First, we filter the `farm` table to find farms with `Total_Cattle` greater than 100.\n\n4. **Join Tables for Competition and Farm Filtering**:\n   - We need to join `competition_record` with the filtered list of farms from step 3 to get competition records only for those farms.\n\n5. **Perform Vector Similarity Search**:\n   - Use the `Theme_embedding` column in `farm_competition` to find themes that are most similar to \"agricultural festival\". This is done using the vector search syntax provided: `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`.\n\n6. **Combine Results to Get Top Matches**:\n   - Join the results of the vector search with the filtered competition records from step 4 to get the top 5 relevant competitions and their associated farm IDs.\n\n7. **Final Output**:\n   - Sort the results by similarity and select the top 5 matches.\n\nNow, let's construct the SQL query following these steps:\n\n```sql\nWITH FilteredFarms AS (\n    SELECT Farm_ID\n    FROM farm\n    WHERE Total_Cattle > 100\n),\nRelevantCompetitions AS (\n    SELECT cr.Competition_ID, cr.Farm_ID\n    FROM competition_record cr\n    JOIN FilteredFarms ff ON cr.Farm_ID = ff.Farm_ID\n),\nTopMatches AS (\n    SELECT Competition_ID\n    FROM farm_competition\n    WHERE Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'agricultural festival') AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT rc.Competition_ID, rc.Farm_ID\nFROM RelevantCompetitions rc\nJOIN TopMatches tm ON rc.Competition_ID = tm.Competition_ID;\n```",
      "To address the given task, we need to perform a vector similarity search to find competitions related to the theme \"agricultural festival\" and filter them based on farms having more than 100 cattle. Here’s how we can break down the task:\n\n1. **Identify Competitions Related to the Theme:**\n   - Use the `farm_competition` table to search for competitions with themes similar to \"agricultural festival\" using vector similarity.\n   - The query must include `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N` to find the top 5 matches.\n\n2. **Filter Farms with More Than 100 Cattle:**\n   - Use the `farm` table to filter farms where `Total_Cattle` is greater than 100.\n   - Join this result with `competition_record` to get the relevant competitions associated with these farms.\n\n3. **Join and Order Results:**\n   - Join the filtered competitions from the vector search with the filtered farms join.\n   - Sort the results by similarity (implicitly done by the vector search operation).\n\nLet's translate this into the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nWITH FilteredFarms AS (\n    SELECT \n        cr.Competition_ID, \n        cr.Farm_ID\n    FROM \n        competition_record cr\n    JOIN \n        farm f ON cr.Farm_ID = f.Farm_ID\n    WHERE \n        f.Total_Cattle > 100\n),\nTopCompetitions AS (\n    SELECT \n        Competition_ID,\n        Theme_embedding\n    FROM \n        farm_competition\n    WHERE \n        Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'agricultural festival') AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT \n    tc.Competition_ID, \n    ff.Farm_ID\nFROM \n    TopCompetitions tc\nJOIN \n    FilteredFarms ff ON tc.Competition_ID = ff.Competition_ID;\n```\n\nThis query satisfies the requirements by using vector similarity for theme matching, filtering farms with more than 100 cattle, and ensuring that we get the top 5 relevant matches.",
      "To construct the SQL query for the given natural language question, we need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Filter Farms with More than 100 Cattle:**\n   - We need to first identify farms that have more than 100 cattle. This can be accomplished by selecting from the `farm` table where `Total_Cattle` is greater than 100.\n\n2. **Join with Competition Record:**\n   - After identifying the relevant farms, we can join this result with the `competition_record` table to find all competitions in which these farms have participated.\n\n3. **Perform Vector Similarity Search on Competitions:**\n   - We need to search for competitions whose themes are most similar to \"Agricultural festival\". This is done using the vector similarity search on the `Theme_embedding` column of the `farm_competition` virtual table. We use the provided syntax to match against the embedding of the search text: `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text')`. We want the top 5 matches, so we will set `k = 5`.\n\n4. **Combine Results and Sort:**\n   - Finally, we join the results of the vector similarity search with the competitions linked to farms with more than 100 cattle. We select both `Competition_ID` and `Farm_ID` from these results.\n\nThe following SQL query implements this logic:\n\n```sql\nWITH FilteredFarms AS (\n    SELECT \n        Farm_ID\n    FROM \n        farm\n    WHERE \n        Total_Cattle > 100\n),\nCompetitionsWithRelevantFarms AS (\n    SELECT \n        cr.Competition_ID, \n        cr.Farm_ID\n    FROM \n        competition_record cr\n    JOIN \n        FilteredFarms ff ON cr.Farm_ID = ff.Farm_ID\n),\nTopCompetitions AS (\n    SELECT \n        Competition_ID\n    FROM \n        farm_competition\n    WHERE \n        Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Agricultural festival') AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT \n    tc.Competition_ID, \n    cwr.Farm_ID\nFROM \n    TopCompetitions tc\nJOIN \n    CompetitionsWithRelevantFarms cwr ON tc.Competition_ID = cwr.Competition_ID;\n```",
      "To solve this problem, we need to find competitions most relevant to an \"agricultural festival\" theme from farms that have more than 100 cattle. The process involves filtering farms first, performing a vector similarity search on competitions, and then joining the results.\n\n1. **Filter Farms**: Identify farms with more than 100 cattle. This is achieved by querying the `farm` table and applying the condition `Total_Cattle > 100`.\n\n2. **Vector Similarity Search**: Use the vector embedding for the theme to find the most relevant competitions. For this, we perform a similarity search on the `Theme_embedding` column in the `farm_competition` table. Use the provided syntax: `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`.\n\n3. **Join and Select**: After identifying the relevant competitions and farms, join these results. The `competition_record` table relates farms to competitions. Hence, join the filtered farms with the selected competitions using this table to find the combination of competition IDs and farm IDs that meet our criteria.\n\n4. **Order and Limit**: Order the results by their similarity score (distance) and limit the results to the top 5 entries.\n\nNow, combining these steps into a complete SQL query:\n\n```sql\nWITH FilteredFarms AS (\n    SELECT Farm_ID\n    FROM farm\n    WHERE Total_Cattle > 100\n),\nRelevantCompetitions AS (\n    SELECT Competition_ID\n    FROM farm_competition\n    WHERE Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'agricultural festival') AND k = 5\n)\nSELECT \n    cr.Competition_ID, \n    cr.Farm_ID\nFROM \n    competition_record cr\nJOIN \n    FilteredFarms ff ON cr.Farm_ID = ff.Farm_ID\nJOIN \n    RelevantCompetitions rc ON cr.Competition_ID = rc.Competition_ID;\n```\n",
      "To address the natural language question, we need to break down the requirements and construct the SQL query step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Competitions with Relevant Themes:**\n   - We should use vector similarity search on the `Theme_embedding` column of the `farm_competition` table to find competitions that match the theme \"Agricultural festival\".\n   - We need to use the specific syntax for vector similarity: `Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N`, where `N` is the number of top matches we want.\n\n2. **Filter Farms by Number of Cattle:**\n   - We need to filter farms to include only those with more than 100 cattle. This will involve the `farm` table, where we check that `Total_Cattle > 100`.\n\n3. **Join Competitions and Farms:**\n   - Once we have the relevant competitions and filtered farms, we need to join them using the `competition_record` table to associate competition IDs with the filtered farm IDs.\n\n4. **Return Required Information:**\n   - The output should include both the competition IDs and farm IDs for the top 5 matches, sorted by similarity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step SQL query construction:\n\n- **Step 1:** Perform a vector similarity search on the `farm_competition` table to find the top 5 competitions matching the theme \"Agricultural festival\".\n- **Step 2:** Filter farms with more than 100 cattle from the `farm` table.\n- **Step 3:** Join the results of the vector search with the `competition_record` table to get the farm IDs that match the filtered conditions.\n- **Step 4:** Select and order the required columns.\n\nThe final SQL query will be structured as follows:\n\n```sql\nWITH RelevantCompetitions AS (\n    SELECT \n        Competition_ID\n    FROM \n        farm_competition\n    WHERE \n        Theme_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'Agricultural festival') AND k = 5\n),\nFilteredFarms AS (\n    SELECT \n        Farm_ID\n    FROM \n        farm\n    WHERE \n        Total_Cattle > 100\n)\nSELECT \n    rc.Competition_ID, \n    cr.Farm_ID\nFROM \n    RelevantCompetitions rc\nJOIN \n    competition_record cr ON rc.Competition_ID = cr.Competition_ID\nJOIN \n    FilteredFarms ff ON cr.Farm_ID = ff.Farm_ID;\n```"

Here's a detailed breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the SQL query:\n\n1. **Understand the Question Requirements**: \n   - We need to find train numbers.\n   - The trains must start from London.\n   - These trains pass through the top 5 stations most related to \"London Overground and London Trains\".\n   - The average high temperature on Mondays at these stations must be greater than 15 degrees.\n   - Results must be ordered by train number.\n   - Limit the output to 10 train numbers.\n\n2. **Identify Relevant Tables and Columns**:\n   - The `train` table is essential to get train numbers and origins.\n   - The `station` table is used to find relevant stations based on vector similarity.\n   - The `route` table connects trains to stations.\n   - The `weekly_weather` table provides temperature data.\n\n3. **Vector Similarity for Station Selection**:\n   - Use vector similarity search in the `station` table for the services related to \"London Overground and London Trains\" using `MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text')` and specify `k = 5`.\n\n4. **Temperature Condition**:\n   - Filter stations where the average high temperature on Mondays exceeds 15 degrees using a subquery.\n\n5. **Join Tables**:\n   - Join `station` to `route` on `station_id`, and `route` to `train` on `train_id`.\n\n6. **Apply Conditions and Select Required Outputs**:\n   - Filter trains that originate from London.\n   - Order results by train number.\n   - Limit results to 10 entries.\n\nHere's the final SQL query based on these steps:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.train_number\nFROM station s\nJOIN route r ON s.id = r.station_id\nJOIN train t ON r.train_id = t.id\nWHERE s.services_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'London Overground and London Trains') AND k = 5\nAND t.origin = 'London'\nAND (\n    SELECT AVG(w.high_temperature) \n    FROM weekly_weather w \n    WHERE w.station_id = s.id AND w.day_of_week = 'Monday'\n) > 15\nORDER BY t.train_number\nLIMIT 10;\n```",
      "To solve the problem, we need to perform multiple tasks:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant tables**:\n   - The `train` table contains information about trains such as train number and origin.\n   - The `station` is a virtual table used for performing vector searches, which will help find stations related to \"London Overground and London Trains\".\n   - The `route` table connects `train` and `station` tables, indicating which trains pass through which stations.\n   - The `weekly_weather` table provides weather information for each station on specific days.\n\n2. **Perform vector similarity search**:\n   - Use the `services_embedding` column in the `station` table to find stations most related to \"London Overground and London Trains\".\n   - Use the syntax `MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N` to get the top 5 related stations.\n\n3. **Filter trains originating from London**:\n   - Use the `origin` column in the `train` table to filter trains starting from London.\n\n4. **Check weather conditions**:\n   - Calculate the average high temperature on Mondays at the identified stations using the `weekly_weather` table.\n   - Ensure the average high temperature is greater than 15 degrees.\n\n5. **Select train numbers and limit results**:\n   - Retrieve train numbers from the filtered dataset.\n   - Use `ORDER BY train_number` to sort the results by train number.\n   - Limit the results to the top 10 train numbers.\n\nBased on the outlined steps, the SQL query will be structured as follows:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.train_number\nFROM station s\nJOIN route r ON s.id = r.station_id\nJOIN train t ON r.train_id = t.id\nWHERE s.services_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', \"London Overground and London Trains\") AND k = 5\nAND t.origin = 'London'\nAND (\n    SELECT AVG(w.high_temperature)\n    FROM weekly_weather w\n    WHERE w.station_id = s.id AND w.day_of_week = 'Monday'\n) > 15\nORDER BY t.train_number\nLIMIT 10;\n```",
      "To solve the problem, we need to identify trains starting from London that pass through the top 5 stations most closely related to \"London Overground and London Trains\", and ensure that the average high temperature on Mondays at these stations is greater than 15 degrees. The results should be ordered by train number and limited to 10.\n\nLet's break down the steps required to formulate the correct SQL query:\n\n1. **Vector Similarity Search**: Use the vector similarity search syntax to find the top 5 stations related to \"London Overground and London Trains\". The given syntax for vector similarity search in the `station` table is:\n   ```sql\n   services_embedding MATCH lembed('model_name', 'search_text') AND k = N\n   ```\n   In this case, `model_name` is 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2', `search_text` is \"London Overground and London Trains\", and `k = 5`.\n\n2. **Filter Trains Originating from London**: We need to filter trains that have their origin in London. This requires checking the `train` table for trains where `origin = 'London'`.\n\n3. **Average High Temperature on Mondays**: We need to ensure that the average high temperature on Mondays at these stations is greater than 15 degrees. This requires a subquery to select the average `high_temperature` from the `weekly_weather` table for each station on Mondays.\n\n4. **Joins and Filtering**: Join the `station` table with the `route` table on `station_id` and `train_id` to get the `train` information. Then, apply the necessary filters using WHERE conditions.\n\n5. **Order and Limit the Results**: Finally, order the results by `train_number` and limit the output to the top 10 train numbers.\n\nConsidering these steps, the complete SQL query becomes:\n\n```sql\nSELECT t.train_number\nFROM station s\nJOIN route r ON s.id = r.station_id\nJOIN train t ON r.train_id = t.id\nWHERE s.services_embedding MATCH lembed('all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'London Overground and London Trains') AND k = 5\nAND t.origin = 'London'\nAND (\n    SELECT AVG(w.high_temperature)\n    FROM weekly_weather w\n    WHERE w.station_id = s.id AND w.day_of_week = 'Monday'\n) > 15\nORDER BY t.train_number\nLIMIT 10;\n```"
