**Task Overview:**
Given a table in Markdown format, your task is to complete the following three tasks:

## Task 1
Analyze the table's header and rows to briefly summarize its domain. The output domain should be surrounded by [START_DOMAIN] and [END_DOMAIN].

## Task 2
Based on the table, propose a complex, enterprise-level, real-world business scenario. The output scenario should be surrounded by [START_SCENARIO] and [END_SCENARIO].

## Task 3
Create a comprehensive database schema in json format for the proposed business scenario. The output database schema should be surrounded by [START_DATABASE_SCHEMA] and [END_DATABASE_SCHEMA].

The schema for each table should comprise the following seven key attributes:
- `table_name`: The identifier or name assigned to the table. 
- `table_description`: A brief narrative explaining the purpose or content of the table.
- `column_names`: A list of all column names within the table. Note that some column names might be abbreviations or non-descriptive strings, reflecting potential annotation inconsistencies in real-world database scenarios.
- `column_types`: The data types assigned to each column, acknowledging that some types might be more complex (e.g., Date, Array, Struct) than basic data types.
- `column_descriptions`: Detailed explanations for each column, providing semantic clarity on the data they hold.
- `primary_key`: The column(s) designated as the primary key for the table, ensuring the uniqueness of each row.
- `sample_rows`: An inclusion of five sample rows of data for the table, offering a practical glimpse into the table's data structure and content.

Upon detailing all tables, establish and define the foreign key relationships within the database schema:
- `foreign_keys`: A specification of the relationships between tables, indicating the source table, the referenced table, and the columns that are involved in this relationship.

Here are the refined notes for Task 3:
1. **Database Schema Design**: Develop a detailed and comprehensive set of tables and columns to accurately represent the complexity, scalability, and real-world business requirements of an enterprise-level application.
2. **Table and Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensure that the specified number of tables are created, incorporating the appropriate number of foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity and relationships.
3. **Ultra-Wide Tables**: Incorporate ultra-wide tables in your schema design, featuring 15-50 columns, to accommodate complex data structures and business needs.
4. **Naming Convention**(Important rules): {name_format}

Here, we present two demonstrations for reference:
**Demonstration 1:**
Complete the tasks and generate a database schema containing 5 tables based on the following table:

University Document Management and Resource Tracking
[END_DOMAIN]

[START_SCENARIO]
An enterprise-level university system is implementing a Document Management and Analytics Platform to handle educational resources, training materials, and institutional guidelines. The platform should support various academic and administrative departments, allowing them to upload, manage, and track the usage of important documents, such as training guides, course syllabi, contracts, and instructional resources. Departments need robust analytics tools to monitor document usage across different sites and ensure that up-to-date information is easily accessible.

Each department should have the ability to categorize documents, assign authorship, and monitor user engagement. The platform should also feature granular reporting capabilities to highlight which resources are most used, help identify outdated materials, and track access across different organizational units.

The system must accommodate complex relationships between documents, such as parent/child relationships for versions of documents, shared ownership across departments, and detailed history for document updates and revisions. Additionally, advanced user roles and permissions are required to manage document access and editing rights.

Environmental Data Collection and Analysis
[END_DOMAIN]

[START_SCENARIO]
An international environmental research organization is developing an enterprise-level data management system to collect, store, and analyze environmental data from various sites around the world. The system will handle data related to greenhouse gases, air quality, and other environmental metrics. The organization needs a robust platform that can manage multiple datasets, track data collection methods, and provide detailed metadata for each dataset.

The system must support multiple sites, each with its own unique data collection methods and frequencies. It should also allow for the categorization of data by type (e.g., greenhouse gases, air quality) and provide detailed documentation (readme files) for each dataset. The platform should enable researchers to access and analyze data efficiently, with advanced search and filtering capabilities. Additionally, the system must support versioning of datasets to track changes over time and ensure data integrity.

The organization also requires a comprehensive user management system to control access to sensitive environmental data, with roles and permissions tailored to researchers, data analysts, and administrators. The platform should facilitate collaboration among different research teams and provide reporting tools to monitor data usage and trends.
